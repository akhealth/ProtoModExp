+ "\A \2709  USWDS Notifications"
+ "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
+ "\A 3.0.0"
+ "\A - Settings: We deprecated the $output-all-utilities setting."
+ "\A   Control utility output with $output-these-utilities."
+ "\A   See designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/settings for more."
+ "\A "
+ "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
+ "\A 3.1.0"
+ "\A - Accessibility: We added `type='button'` to all buttons that"
+ "\A   do not submit a form. All your non-form project buttons will"
+ "\A   need `type='button'`."
+ "\A - Accessibility: We updated the markup in the usa-password package"
+ "\A   to use a <button> element instead of an anchor element."
+ "\A - Accessibility: Elements that get `aria-disabled` instead of"
+ "\A   `disabled` are now styled as disabled."
+ "\A - Compatibility: We're using some CSS selectors not supported"
+ "\A   by IE11."
+ "\A - Deprecated: We deprecated the embed-container() mixin."
+ "\A - Display: We removed the outline circle from social media icons."
+ "\A - Settings: We changed the default value of $theme-hero-image."
+ "\A   Teams that use the default image (hero.png) will need to get the"
+ "\A   new image (hero.jpg) from the distribution package."
+ "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
+ "\A 3.2.0"
+ "\A - Accessibility: We changed `div.usa-identifier__identity` to "
+ "\A   `section.usa-identifier__identity` (we changed the div to a "
+ "\A   section) so the ARIA label is associated with an non-div element."
+ "\A - Accessibility: We updated the aria-label in English versions of"
+ "\A   section.usa-banner to 'Official website of the United States "
+ "\A   government' to reduce ambiguity in screen reader vocalizations. "
+ "\A   Previously, 'An official' could be misunderstood as 'unofficial'."
+ "\A - Accessibility: We added `aria-hidden='true'` to the parent div "
+ "\A   of `p.usa-banner__header-text` in usa-banner. We also "
+ "\A   removed `aria-hidden='true'` from `p.usa-banner__header-action`. "
+ "\A   Together these assure that the proper elements are read in the"
+ "\A   banner."
+ "\A - Accessibility: In the lock icon SVG in usa-banner, we changed the "
+ "\A   value of aria-labelledby to  "
+ "\A   `aria-labelledby='banner-lock-description'` and updated the value"
+ "\A   of desc#banner-lock-description to `'Locked padlock'` to simplify"
+ "\A   the vocalization."
+ "\A - Accessibility: We added `aria-hidden='true' to "
+ "\A   `img.usa-banner__header-flag` in usa-banner since this is a"
+ "\A   decorative image."
+ "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
+ "\A 3.4.0"
+ "\A - Compatibility: We no longer include ttf and woff fonts in our "
+ "\A   @font-face rules. If you need these files for IEll compatibility,"
+ "\A   add `$theme-font-browser-compatibility: true` to your project"
+ "\A   settings."
+ "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
+ "\A 3.5.0"
+ "\A - Sass: Removed `usa-prose-` mixins and placeholders from Sass."
+ "\A   This is a breaking change only if your project Sass uses "
+ "\A   `usa-prose-` mixins and placeholders. Users should instead use "
+ "\A   `typeset-` mixins in their place."
+ "\A - Settings: Now adjusting a single Sass map setting will no "
+ "\A   longer set all other values in the map to `false`. Users can"
+ "\A   now update only the map values they wish to change. This is a "
+ "\A   breaking change only if your project deactivated mapped "
+ "\A   settings by not declaring them."
+ "\A - Accessibility: [form controls] We improved the consistency and "
+ "\A   visibility of disabled styles. Teams should check disabled form "
+ "\A   elements to assure that the new styles are working in their "
+ "\A   layouts."
+ "\A - Accessibility: [usa-pagination] Replace the "
+ "\A   `role=\"presentation\"` with `aria-label=\"ellipsis indicating "
+ "\A   non-visible pages\" in `usa-pagination__overflow` items."
+ "\A - Accessibility: [usa-card] Use link elements in"
+ "\A   any card component for calls to action instead of buttons. Use "
+ "\A   `<a href=\"#\" class=\"usa-button\"></a>` for these "
+ "\A   call-to-action links."
+ "\A - Content: [usa-identifier] We updated the accessibility statement"
+ "\A   link text. Use the text \"Accessibility statement\" (EN) "
+ "\A   or \"Declaraci√≥n de accesibilidad\" (ES) for the required "
+ "\A   link to an accessibility statement."
+ "\A - Guidance [usa-link]: We now suggest using the `rel=\"noreferrer\"`"
+ "\A   property on external links. This prevents the browser from leaking "
+ "\A   information about the original web address."
+ "\A - Guidance [usa-form]: We now suggest identifying both required "
+ "\A   and optional fields in forms. Label required fields with a red"
+ "\A   asterisk and optional fields with the word \"optional\"."
